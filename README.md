# Lambda Foundations

## Module 5 - Javascript - Conditionals

### Module 3 Project

Today we learned about conditional statements in Javascript. The heart of all computer algorithms are conditional statements. We also learned about loops and Comparison operators. In this project we will be working with all three of these concepts.

### Getting Started

In order to get started you will need to download this project as a .zip file and open it in VS Code (like Modules 1 and 2). Here are the instructions to do so:

1. Click on the Green button that says Code in the upper right-hand side of the screen.
2. You will see an option at the bottom called Download Zip.
3. You will need to find the place the .zip file is downloaded to. This will usually be the Downloads folder on your computer. Tip: if you are using Chrome, you should be able to click on the download itself in the bottom left-hand corner of your browse, this will open the location of the downloaded file in My Computer or Finder.
4. Double-click on the .zip file itself. Once you unzip the file you should see a Folder or Directory with the name "Web-Foundations-Module-3" next to the .zip file.
5. Either drag and drop the entire folder onto the VS Code icon, OR open VS Code -> click on File > Open -> Find the folder from step 4 -> Click open.
6. Open the index.html file in your browser. In most cases you can drag and drop the HTML file directly to your open browser screen.

### Analyze the Code

Before you open the project, one thing to note. A LOT of code has already been written. This may be overwhelming at first, that's OK! Take a moment and just analyze the code that has already been written. Are there elements that you recognize? Are there elements that you've never seen before? Take note of these things. A major skill in software development is learning to read the code that is already there and figuring out where to insert your own code. We've done that step for you today but as an exercise try and answer the questions below:

1. On lines 2 - 8 in `index.js` what value will `canDrive` be assigned when the code has been run?

2. On lines 10 - 23 in `index.js` will all three truth statements be evaluated?

3. On lines 10 - 23 in `index.js` what value will `fees` be assigned when the code has been run?

4. In the `for loop` on lines 25 - 39, will this code run? If not where is the error?

### Try it out

The `Try it Out` portion of this project will take place in two parts.

**Part One:** The first part is located in the `index.js` file.

- Comment out (or delete) the code on lines 2-34.
- Starting on line 38 you will find your instructions.
- When you complete the instructions, link to the `index.js` file in your `index.html` file.
- Open `index.html` in your browser.
- If the beaker fills perfectly you are free to move on to the next section. Else, continue tweaking your for loop until you get it to fill.

**Part Two:**

- Now with the beaker full and the file open in your browser, answer the quiz questions. Be sure to pay attention to detail and read the code carefully.
- Once you get 28/30 questions correct, the password will appear at the bottom of the screen.
- You may need to work through the questions multiple times in order to get a passing score. This is by design, the more time you spend reading and analyzing code, the faster you will pick it up!

### Go further

In this section, we'd like you to take your learning into your own hands! It is an important skill to be able to find the answers you are seeking on the internet while working on a software project. In today's case, Google will be your friend. We've highlighted some potential Google search phrases, but try to think of how you would word your search on your own.

1. Loops. There are many different kinds of loops in Javascript. Research and discover two other loops.

Loop One: [Write Your Answer Here]

Loop Two: [Write Your Answer Here]

Why do you think there are multiple styles of loops? What could other loops be used for?

### In Your Own Words

An impactful technique in learning something new is attempting to reiterate the concepts you just learned from memory in your own words. This allows you to highlight areas you are not comfortable with and could study on a little more. We'll start this exercise off pretty simply. Just remember that this is merely an exercise, there are no right or wrong answers here. Please answer the following question in your own words

1. What does a comparison operator do?

[Write Your Answer Here]

2. What does a conditional statement do?

[Write Your Answer Here]

2. What does a for loop statement do?

### Complete the Assignment

Once you are completed with all of the above exercises, find the Folder `Web-Foundations-Module-3` in your Finder or My Computer. Right-click on the folder and select "Compress Web-Foundations-Module-3". This will create a .zip file. Upload this .zip file to Canvas the same way you uploaded your .txt file yesterday.
